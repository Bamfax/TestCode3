TestCode3
=========

Note: The changes after commit 30 are mostly to get Gtune working. Testing on my 2 units suggests it is very well. Yaw tune is blocked for everything with less than 4 motors. ToDo: The function needs a writeup in the readme.txt. There is no special function for saving the tuned parameters. If after tuning an eeprom write is triggered (like saving trims or hitting save in gui etc.) the tuned P values will be saved along. I know it is dirty but it will be left that way to save ram.
